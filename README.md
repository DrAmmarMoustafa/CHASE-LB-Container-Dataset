# CHASE-LB-Container-Dataset
The CHASE-LB (Container-based Host-Level Anomaly Detection System Call Traces - Linux-Based) dataset is a realistic and contemporary resource designed to address the critical need for relevant data in the field of container security
It captures system call traces emanating from popular web applications running within Docker containers, reflecting both normal and malicious (attack) behaviors in modern cloud-native environments.

This dataset was created to overcome the limitations of existing datasets, which are often outdated, lack attack diversity, or are not specifically tailored for containerized architectures. As demonstrated in the source paper, machine learning models trained on CHASE-LB significantly outperform those trained on other benchmark datasets like LID-DS, proving its superior quality and relevance.
Key Features

    High Realism: Reflects the behavior of real-world, widely-used web applications (WordPress, MySQL, PHP) operating in an isolated container environment.

    Modern Attack Scenarios: Includes a diverse set of modern and impactful attacks based on recent OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25 lists, covering vulnerabilities (CVEs) discovered up to 2024.

    Container-Specific: All data was collected from a Docker container environment, making it ideal for developing and evaluating Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) for such setups.

    Rich Data Structure: Each record is enriched with contextual information (trace ID, timestamp, detailed syscall information, success/failure indicators), enabling the application of both traditional and deep machine learning techniques.

    Clear Labels: Every trace is unambiguously labeled as either Normal or Attack, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

    Ready for ML Processing: The dataset is structured to be compatible with common feature extraction techniques like N-Grams and TF-IDF.

Attack Scenarios

Vulnerabilities were carefully selected to cover a wide range of common threats in web applications and container environments, based on authoritative sources like NVD and OWASP. The primary attack categories include:

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - (e.g., CVE-2021-36905)

    OS Command Injection - (e.g., CVE-2019-15107)

    SQL Injection - (e.g., CVE-2020-9483, CVE-2017-5638)

    Path Traversal - (e.g., CVE-2020-17518, CVE-2021-41773)

    Unrestricted File Upload - (e.g., CVE-2019-25213)

    Container Escapes (File Descriptor Leak) - (e.g., CVE-2024-21626)

    PHP Object Injection - (e.g., CVE-2020-35939)

Attacks were executed using well-known penetration testing tools such as Metasploit, sqlmap, and OWASP ZAP.
Data Structure

The dataset is provided in a format that is easy to parse, where each record represents a single system call with the following fields:

    trace_id: A unique identifier grouping system calls belonging to the same execution scenario (normal or attack).

    timestamp: The precise timestamp of the system call.

    syscall_id: The numerical ID of the system call.

    syscall_name: The symbolic name of the system call (e.g., openat, read, write).

    param_count: The number of arguments passed to the call.

    param_types: The types of the parameters.

    data_length: The length of data associated with the call (if any).

    flag: Flags used in the system call.

    return_value: The value returned by the call.

    success: A boolean indicator of the call's success or failure.

    error_code: The error code if the call failed.

    label: The class label (0 for Normal, 1 for Attack).

Collection and Processing Methodology

    Environment Setup: An isolated lab environment was created using VMware, running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the host OS with Docker installed to run the application containers (WordPress, MySQL).

    Data Collection: The Sysdig tool was used to monitor and log all system calls issued by the containers to the host kernel.

    Behavior Generation:

        Normal Behavior: Generated by simulating legitimate user interactions, including content management, browsing articles, user administration, and database maintenance.

        Attack Behavior: Executed by exploiting the predefined vulnerabilities using specialized tools.

    Preprocessing: A pipeline of preprocessing steps was applied to the raw system call traces, including segmentation into N-Grams (N=3), vectorization using TF-IDF, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
